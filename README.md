# [Twitch Bot JS (TBJS)](http://matthewsh.github.io/tbjs/)

## About
I know you're curious about what the hell this is project is about. Well simply put, I needed another project to work on because some of my others were finished.
And because I've also enjoyed working on chat bots and IRC bots, I've decided I might as well join in and work on a chat bot for TwitchTV myself.
This project is focused for developers (advanced or experienced) and for normal users.

## Using TBJS

### NodeJS
 1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/MatthewSH/TwitchBotJS.git`).
 2. Navigate to the directory (`cd TwitchBotJS`).
 3. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
Now you're all set. Just modify the example configuration and you can spin up an example bot using the `node` command. The examples are located in `src/examples`.

*Will update this whenever I get the task list going*

### Electron (UI Version)

*Will put this in later*

## Task List
Everything this bot has , I'm talking everything from the base to the features.
A little clarification for the modules, it's just a library of commands and such I feel like the bot should have.
